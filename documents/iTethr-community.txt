iTethr Community Structure
This document is intended solely for internal use and strategic partner review. Do not copy,
distribute, or disclose without prior written consent from AeonovX SIA.
Community System Overview
iTethr's community infrastructure is built on a three-tier hierarchical system designed for
structured organizational management, particularly suited for educational institutions,
corporations, and large-scale communities.
📍 What is Community Plus?
Community Plus is the top-level organizational structure designed for institutions like
universities, corporations, or large organizations. It serves as the umbrella entity that contains
and manages multiple subsidiary communities called Hubs.
📍 What are Hubs (Subsidiaries)?
Hubs are subsidiary communities within a Community Plus, representing departments,
divisions, or specific groups. Each Hub functions as a semi-autonomous community with its
own members, rooms, and management structure. Hubs can also exist independently outside
of any Community Plus.
📍 What are Rooms?
Rooms are the most granular level of organization within Hubs - similar to Discord channels
or Telegram groups. They serve as focused spaces for specific topics, courses, projects, or
discussions. Every Hub contains default rooms and can have additional custom rooms created
by administrators.

↓
🔧 Prof. Williams automatically becomes admin of:
├── i/Computer Science hub
├── General room (default)
├── i/Announcements room (default)
