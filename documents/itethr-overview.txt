Overview
iTethr is a next-generation community infrastructure platform designed for international students,
organizations, creators, and global users to build structured communities, offer services, and
interact through real-time social engagement tools.
The First Generation of iTethr focuses on a high-impact, scalable MVP with deeply integrated
AI features, modular spaces, and a core trust-driven social layer.
This document outlines the full backend architecture, data flows, modules, user journey, and
developer integration blueprint.
1. User Account System
1.1 Supported Sign-Up Methods
• Sign Up with Google (OAuth2)
• Sign Up with Apple (OAuth2)
• Sign Up with Email + Password (Default Path)
1.2 Email Sign-Up Flow
iTethr simplifies the login and onboarding process to minimize friction. Users are onboarded
through a quick 3-step setup, with progressive profile building handled later from the profile
screen.
1. Step 1: Enter Username, Password, (required)
2. Step 2: Select Gender (optional), Date of Birth (required)
3. Step 3: Interests Selection (optional), Accept Privacy Policy (required)
After completing onboarding, users land directly in Home with access to their private
‘You’ chat and any pre-joined community. Full profile customization and setup can
be done gradually afterward.
1.3 Identity Fields Stored
username (unique, lowercase), password_hash, dob, gender (optional) privacy_accepted: true,
joined_at, last_active , auth_method (email/google/apple)
2. Home Interface Layout
iTethr introduces a revolutionary and unconventional design that breaks away from traditional
social apps. Ditching the standard navigation bar, iTethr uses a bubble-based interface that is
spatial, intuitive, and visually engaging.
Instead of navigating through tabs, users interact with floating animated bubbles that represent
their Communities, Loops, and Contacts. It creates an immersive sense of presence rather than
just movement between screens.
2.1 Key UI Elements:
• Top Left: Profile icon for account settings
• Top Right: Notifications and Marketplace
• Bottom Center: A persistent Smart Search bar that lets users ask questions or interact
with Aeono AI anytime
• Center Bubble UI: Interactive floating circles for Communities, Loops, and Tethr
connections
• Floating Create Button: For instantly launching new Posts, Communities, Hubs, or
Loops
This novel layout doesn’t just look different it feels different. It’s designed for flow,
freedom, and meaningful discovery. A digital landscape where users move naturally
between moments of interaction, without relying on static menus or navigation tabs.
3. Spaces Architecture (Global Navigation)
Spaces are modular, navigable zones inside the iTethr interface. By default, every user has access
to three main Spaces:
3.1 Home Space
• Community Circles joined
• Circles and Community feeds
• Private Chats (1-on-1)
• “You” – a self-chat space for journaling, notes, and drafts
3.2 Global Space
• iFeed (Global feed - Tethrs / Global tabs)
• Loops (Real-time trending discussion threads)

3.3 Favourite Space
• Pinned: Rooms, Community Plus, Communities, Spaces, Loops
• Fully user customizable
3.4 Custom Spaces
• Users can create additional personal Spaces by swiping from the home screen.
• These Spaces can be named freely, and used for personal organization or creator
dashboards.
• Example: “Study Room”, “Content Zone”, “Startup Notes”
3.5 Long-Press Across Spaces:
Within each Space, the following items support Long-Press Actions:
• Private Chats → Mute, Report, Pin, Share, Add to Loop
• Communities / Hubs → View Info, Pin, Leave, Insights
• Loops → Share, Save, Start Post from Loop, Pin to Profile
• Space itself → Rename, Delete (if personal), Duplicate
4. Create Button (Action Center)

Rooms cannot be created directly, they are created only inside Hubs (single-layer) or
within a Community Plus by admins.

Events & Services are created inside the Marketplace module.

5. User Profiles
iTethr users are at the center of the ecosystem. Whether you’re a student, freelancer, creator, or
organization member, your profile reflects your identity, reputation, and contributions.
Each user has a card-style profile that showcases their key identity attributes and engagement
stats. Alongside their username, every user also has a unique Personal ID, which is more
reliable and permanent than usernames. This Personal ID ensures long-term discoverability,
smart search indexing, and future-proof scaling.
Users can also verify their identity to receive role-specific verification badges such as Student,
Professional, or Freelancer. This helps build credibility and enhances visibility across the
platform.
5.1 Personal Profile
• Unique User ID and Username (both searchable)
• Name, Bio, Location, Skills, Interests
• Tethrd Level – a dynamic score based on your engagement
• Trust Score – a system-generated credibility score
• Your posts, offered services, and endorsements from others
• Public profile link for sharing outside the platform
• Optional verification badge (Student / Freelancer / Professional)
5.2 Connection System
On iTethr, if User A finds User B, they can send a Tethr Request to connect. There are two
types of Tethr paths:
• If User B has a public profile, Tethring happens instantly
• If User B requires approval, they must accept the request to complete the connection
Once User A and B are Tethred:
• They can view each other’s full profile
• They can send private messages
• They can request help or offer services
Tethring is not like ‘follow’ or ‘follow back’ it’s a mutual, consent-based connection system
designed for meaningful interactions.
Profiles are discoverable via Aeono and connected across iTethr’s features from chats to
marketplace and beyond.

are surfaced and shared globally. Users can like, comment, share, and save posts for
engagement and follow-up.

o Loop activity
7. Community System

15. Sample User Flow
iTethr is designed to onboard users quickly and intentionally. Unlike other platforms that
overload users immediately after login, iTethr ensures a clean, minimal entry. Users only
experience their private chat space (“You”) and any Community they’ve been invited to
everything else unfolds based on engagement.
Users can customize or build their profile gradually, allowing them to focus on connection first,
and setup later. This phased approach ensures better user retention and deeper discovery over
time.

• Student clicks the link → redirected to iTethr

o Their private self-chat space called “You”
o The Community they joined via the invite

• Requests verification to gain a Freelancer badge, increasing trust and visibility
• Lists services in Marketplace under categorized listings

o Join relevant Hubs or Communities for networking Freelancer signs up and sets up
profile

• Chooses visibility: Public / Private / Request-to-join
• Invites members manually, shares a link, or circulates a Loop to attract users into the
community
